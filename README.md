# Starlette + API Star + uvicorn Demo site

With API Star 0.6 the server component has been split off, so now we
need to install more packages to get the same functionality.

This makes sense in the long term, but in the short term there wasn't
a lot of documentation around to explain how to put all the pieces
together.

So i'm making this code available in the hope that it might help somone
with their API Star 0.6.0, Starlette server, and Uvicorn issues.
